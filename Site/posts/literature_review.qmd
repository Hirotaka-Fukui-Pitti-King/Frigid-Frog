# the consequences of technological progress in financial markets

> "Some of my research has investigated the consequences of technological progress in financial markets, which allows investment to be directed toward the most profitable production opportunities in the economy, thereby increasing income and productivity. Recently I have explored how efficiency in both financial and patent markets affect technology adoption and growth. For example, how does the efficiency of financial markets affect funding for the development of advanced technologies? Path-breaking technologies may be expensive to develop and involve long and risky gestation lags. These factors make bank financing unsuitable for startups developing path-breaking technologies. Does the rise of venture capital spur the development of new technologies by startups? Inventors often create ideas that they themselves cannot commericalize. Firms may hatch ideas that are far outside of their core lines of business and hence are hard to take to market. Are firms and inventors more likely to develop new ideas when they can patent and sell them?"
